WINDOWS VERSIONS THEGAME!
How to run THEGAME:
   1. download files from github (/Tkinter-Game/Windows/YOURWINDOWSVERSION(xp, 7, 10)/THEGAMEEXE/)
   2. unzip THEGAMEEXE (if you want to play in Windows xp, you must unzip the folder on a different os ( later than windows xp), because windows xp can't unzip files archived in a newer os than xp)
   3. Run THEGAMEEXE.exe 
   + The Sound in the game is too loud, I recommend lowering the volume. Sound volume may very depending on os, driver and etc.)
   Have FUN!!!!  :))
